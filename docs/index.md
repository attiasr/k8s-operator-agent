   K8s Operator Agent documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Jan 25 11:22:20 2024.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

title: K8s Operator Agent

The user doesn't see the prompt of the LLM, instead the the k8s-operator-agent
handles the interactions with the LLM directly. This allows an interface
with the k8s cluster directly.
